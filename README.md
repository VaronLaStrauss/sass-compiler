# sass-compiler

This project is just to compile scss files into css files using webpack. Files are NOT bundled together, but they are saved per declaration in the entry list in `webpack.config.js`

Installation:
`npm install`

Running:
`npm start`

To add css files, add them to the `entry` inside `webpack.config.js` file, and restart the webpack.
